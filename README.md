## Overview

**Under Development**

_mcp-scaffold_ is a scaffold environment for MCP testing and development. It aims to provide low-friction modification of MCP servers and connectors, along with an idiomatic client-server implementation. The project evolves alongside the MCP specification, serving as both a reference and a practical implementation guide.
